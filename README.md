# Stack-Data-Structure-Implementations
The stack data structure is a linear data structure that accompanies a principle known as  LIFO (Last In First Out) or
FILO (First In Last Out). Real-life examples of a stack are a deck of cards, piles of books, piles of money, and many more.

There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack.

Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
IsFull: Check if the stack is full
Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it
